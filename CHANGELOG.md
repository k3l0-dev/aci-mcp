## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-24

First public open-source release.

### Added

- `LICENSE` — GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0-or-later).
- `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` — commercial license terms for proprietary integrations.
- `SKILL.md` — LLM skill guide at repo root for client discovery.
- `scripts/list-configurable-classes.sh` — query configurable ACI classes from jsonmeta
  schemas. Options: `--package`, `--exclude-rsrt`, `--count`.
- SPDX license headers (`Copyright (C) 2026 Khalid El-Ouiali — MONARK AIOPS srl /
  SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later`) on all Python source files.
- `[project.authors]`, `[project.urls]`, `classifiers`, `keywords` in both
  `mcp/pyproject.toml` and `schema-collector/pyproject.toml`.

### Changed

- Repository scope narrowed: lab orchestration tooling (`scripts/`, `Makefile`,
  `.env.example`) extracted to the separate `ai-netlab` repository. This repo now
  contains only the MCP server (`mcp/`) and the schema collector (`schema-collector/`).
- Build system removed: Nuitka/UPX standalone binary pipeline (`schema-collector/deploy/`)
  deleted. The schema collector is distributed as Python source only.
- `.gitignore` extended: `.claude/`, `.opencode/`, `.vscode/`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `.markdownlint*`, `.lab*`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- `mcp/middleware/oauth.py` — `OAuthDiscoveryMiddleware`: intercepts
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`,
  returning RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata JSON. Prevents spec-compliant MCP clients
  (OpenCode, Claude Desktop) from crashing on a plain-text "Not Found" response.
- `mcp/middleware/auth.py` — `KeyStore`: thread-safe, hot-reloadable key container.
  `reload()` swaps the key set atomically; in-flight requests are unaffected.
- `mcp/middleware/auth.py` — `RateLimiter`: fixed-window per-IP limiter (default 30 attempts /
  60 s). Returns 429 with `Retry-After: 60` after threshold. Successful requests do not
  consume budget.
- 21 new unit tests for `middleware.auth` (KeyStore, RateLimiter, WWW-Authenticate, hot-reload).
  Total: 199 tests.

### Changed

- `mcp/middleware/auth.py` — `ApiKeyMiddleware` now takes a `KeyStore` instead of a raw
  `frozenset`; accepts an optional `RateLimiter`.
- `mcp/middleware/auth.py` — 401 responses include
  `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="<url>"` per RFC 9728, so clients locate
  the discovery endpoint without probing multiple `/.well-known/` candidates.
- `mcp/main.py` — `ApiKeyMiddleware` is always added to the middleware stack (no-op when
  `KeyStore` is empty, eliminating the conditional branch). `OAuthDiscoveryMiddleware` added
  as outermost middleware in all modes.
- `mcp/main.py` — SIGHUP handler installed at startup: sends `SIGHUP` to reload
  `MCP_API_KEYS` from `.env` without restarting the server.

### Security

- Per-IP rate limiting on failed auth attempts prevents brute-force token enumeration.
- `WWW-Authenticate` header now hints at the discovery URL, allowing clients to complete
  the MCP 2025-03-26 OAuth discovery flow without exposing internal server details.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- `mcp/middleware/auth.py` — `ApiKeyMiddleware`: Starlette `BaseHTTPMiddleware` validating
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-API-Key: <token>` on every incoming request.
  Token comparison uses `hmac.compare_digest` to prevent timing-oracle attacks.
  No-op (with startup warning) when `MCP_API_KEYS` is unset — preserves local dev UX.
- `mcp/deploy/Caddyfile` — TLS-terminating reverse proxy; supports Let's Encrypt (public domain)
  and Caddy's internal CA (LAN/self-signed). Security headers included (`HSTS`, `X-Frame-Options`, …).
- `mcp/deploy/docker-compose.yml` — two-service production stack: `mcp` (internal only) + `caddy`
  (ports 80/443). MCP container is not exposed on the host — all traffic enters via Caddy.
- `mcp/exceptions.py` — `AuthenticationError` added to the exception hierarchy.
- `docs/` — project wiki: architecture diagrams (Mermaid), deployment guides, tools reference,
  internals documentation, and full settings reference.
- 26 new unit tests for `middleware.auth` (load, extract, validate, HTTP integration).

### Changed

- `mcp/pyproject.toml` — version bumped to `0.2.0`; all dependency version constraints
  now have explicit upper bounds.
- `mcp/main.py` — `_serve()` now conditionally applies `ApiKeyMiddleware` via
  `run_http_async(middleware=[...])` when `MCP_API_KEYS` is configured.

### Security

- All MCP endpoints are now protected behind API key authentication when `MCP_API_KEYS` is set.
- TLS is provided end-to-end by Caddy when deployed via `docker-compose.yml`.
- The MCP server port (`8000`) is never exposed directly to the host in the production stack.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `mcp/` — FastMCP server exposing three tools: `search_classes`, `get_schema`, `query`
- `mcp/apic/client.py` — APIC REST client with cookie auth and auto-reauth on 401/403
- `mcp/registry/` — lazy schema loading, keyword search, query-target-filter builder
- `mcp/deploy/Dockerfile` — container image (build context: repo root)
- `mcp/client/` — ready-made MCP client config and LLM skill doc
- `schema-collector/collect.py` — unified CLI (`aci-collect`) replacing four standalone scripts
  - `run` — full pipeline with `--from`, `--concurrency`, `--force`
  - `status` — rich table showing artifact state per APIC version
  - `clean` — remove generated artifacts, with optional `--version` targeting
- Versioned artifact layout: `cobra-sdk/{apic_version}/` and `mo-schemas/{apic_version}/`
- APIC version auto-detected via `firmwareCtrlrRunning` after authentication
- Shared `data/` at monorepo root — written by `schema-collector`, read by `mcp`

### Changed

- Monorepo structure: `mcp/` and `schema-collector/` as independent Python projects
- `class-descriptions.json` centralised in `data/` (was duplicated in both subprojects)
