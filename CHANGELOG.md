## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- `mcp/middleware/auth.py` — `ApiKeyMiddleware`: Starlette `BaseHTTPMiddleware` validating
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-API-Key: <token>` on every incoming request.
  Token comparison uses `hmac.compare_digest` to prevent timing-oracle attacks.
  No-op (with startup warning) when `MCP_API_KEYS` is unset — preserves local dev UX.
- `mcp/deploy/Caddyfile` — TLS-terminating reverse proxy; supports Let's Encrypt (public domain)
  and Caddy's internal CA (LAN/self-signed). Security headers included (`HSTS`, `X-Frame-Options`, …).
- `mcp/deploy/docker-compose.yml` — two-service production stack: `mcp` (internal only) + `caddy`
  (ports 80/443). MCP container is not exposed on the host — all traffic enters via Caddy.
- `mcp/exceptions.py` — `AuthenticationError` added to the exception hierarchy.
- `docs/` — project wiki: architecture diagrams (Mermaid), deployment guides, tools reference,
  internals documentation, and full settings reference.
- `.env.example` — expanded with `MCP_API_KEYS` and `MCP_DOMAIN` variables.
- 26 new unit tests for `middleware.auth` (load, extract, validate, HTTP integration).

### Changed

- `mcp/pyproject.toml` — version bumped to `0.2.0`; added `license = {text = "Proprietary"}`;
  all dependency version constraints now have explicit upper bounds.
- `mcp/main.py` — `_serve()` now conditionally applies `ApiKeyMiddleware` via
  `run_http_async(middleware=[...])` when `MCP_API_KEYS` is configured.

### Security

- All MCP endpoints are now protected behind API key authentication when `MCP_API_KEYS` is set.
- TLS is provided end-to-end by Caddy when deployed via `docker-compose.yml`.
- The MCP server port (`8000`) is never exposed directly to the host in the production stack.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `mcp/` — FastMCP server exposing three tools: `search_classes`, `get_schema`, `query`
- `mcp/apic/client.py` — APIC REST client with cookie auth and auto-reauth on 401/403
- `mcp/registry/` — lazy schema loading, keyword search, query-target-filter builder
- `mcp/deploy/Dockerfile` — container image (build context: repo root)
- `mcp/client/` — ready-made MCP client config and LLM skill doc
- `schema-collector/collect.py` — unified CLI (`aci-collect`) replacing four standalone scripts
  - `run` — full pipeline with `--from`, `--concurrency`, `--force`
  - `status` — rich table showing artifact state per APIC version
  - `clean` — remove generated artifacts, with optional `--version` targeting
- Versioned artifact layout: `cobra-sdk/{apic_version}/` and `mo-schemas/{apic_version}/`
- APIC version auto-detected via `firmwareCtrlrRunning` after authentication
- Shared `data/` at monorepo root — written by `schema-collector`, read by `mcp`
- Shared `.env` at monorepo root — single credentials file for both projects
- `LICENSE` — proprietary license, copyright Khalid El-Ouiali — MONARK AIOPS srl

### Changed

- Monorepo structure: `mcp/` and `schema-collector/` as independent Python projects
- `class-descriptions.json` centralised in `data/` (was duplicated in both subprojects)
